This directory contains a haphazard collection of tools, in a variety of
languages, to analyze slogfiles, a kernelDB, and/or a running Agoric chain.
They were built as-needed to investigate various performance issues, and vary
drastically in quality and usability. They may be useful for analysis and/or
inspiration for more tools. Many of them are specific to the Agoric chain or
solo node, rather than a generic SwingSet instance.
