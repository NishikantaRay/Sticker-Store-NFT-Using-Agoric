# Vat Secondary Storage

The kernel currently provides two secondary storage mechanisms for the use of (application) code running in a vat:

- Virtual objects
- Persistent weak stores

Each of these is accessed via a global made available to vat code.

## Virtual Objects

A virtual object is an object with a durable identity whose state is automatically and transparently backed up in secondary storage.  This means that when a given virtual object is not in active use, it need not occupy any memory within the executing vat.  Thus a vat can manage an arbitrarily large number of such objects without concern about running out of memory.

A virtual object has a "kind", which defines what sort of behavior and state it will possess.  A kind is not exactly a data type, since it comes with a concrete implementation, but it indicates a family of objects that share a set of common behaviors and a common state template.

A vat can define new kinds of virtual object by calling the `makeKind` function provided as a vat global:

  `makeKind(instanceKitMaker)`

The return value from `makeKind` is a maker function which the vat can use to create instances of the newly defined object kind.

The `instanceKitMaker` parameter is a user provided function that binds an in-memory instance of the virtual object with the virtual object's state, associating such instances with the virtual object's behavior.  It is called whenever a new virtual object instance is created, whenever such an instance is swapped in from secondary storage, and whenever a reference to a virtual object is received as a parameter of a message and deserialized.

The `instanceKitMaker` function is passed the virtual object's state as a parameter, and is expected to return a kit object with two properties: `init`, an initialization function; and `self`, a new Javascript object with methods that close over the given state, that will become the body of the new instance.

The `init` function is called when new instances are first created, and is expected to initialize the state object.  Any parameters passed to the maker function returned by `makeKind` are passed directly to the `init` function.

For example:

```javascript
  function counterKitMaker(state) {
    return {
      init(name = 'thing') {
        state.counter = 0;
        state.name = name;
      },
      self: Far('counter', {
        inc() {
          state.counter += 1;
        },
        dec() {
          state.counter -= 1;
        },
        reset() {
          state.counter = 0;
        },
        rename(newName) {
          state.name = newName;
        },
        getCount() {
          return state.counter;
        },
        getName() {
          return state.name;
        },
      }),
    };
  }
```

This function defines a simple counter object with two properties in its state, a count and a name.

You'd define the corresponding virtual object kind with:

  `const counterMaker = makeKind(counterKitMaker);`

and then use it like this:

```javascript
  const fooCounter = counterMaker('foo');
  const barCounter = counterMaker('bar');

  fooCounter.inc();
  fooCounter.inc();
  barCounter.inc();
  barCounter.rename('new bar');
  console.log(`${fooCounter.getName()} count is ${fooCounter.getCount()`); // "foo count is 2"
  console.log(`${barCounter.getName()} count is ${barCounter.getCount()`); // "new bar count is 1"
```

Additional important details:

- The set of state properties is determined by the `init` function.  The properties that exist when `init` returns _are_ the properties of the object.  State properties cannot thereafter be added or removed.

- The values a state property may take are limited to things that are serializable and which may be hardened (and, in fact, _are_ hardened and serialized the moment they are assigned).  That is, you can replace what value a state property _has_, but you cannot modify a state property's value in situ.  In other words, you can do things like:

  `state.zot = [1, 2, 3];`

  but you can't do things like:

  `state.zot.push(4);`

- A virtual object can be passed as a parameter in messages to other vats.  It will be passed by presence, just like any other non-data object you might send in a message parameter.

- A virtual object's state may include references to other virtual objects. The latter objects will be persisted separately and only deserialized as needed, so "swapping in" a virtual object that references other virtual objects does not entail swapping in the entire associated object graph.

- The `self` object returned by the `instanceKitMaker` function _is_ the in-memory representation of the virtual object, so you can capture it inside any of the body methods (as well as the `init` function) in order to pass the virtual object to somebody else.  So you can write things like the following:

```javascript
  function thingKitMaker(state) {
    const self = Far('thing', {
      sendMeTo(somebodyElse) {
        somebodyElse.hereIAm(self);
      },
      ... // and so on
    });
    function init(someParam) {
      otherObject.doSomethingWithMe(self, someParam);
      state.foo = 47;
    },
    return { init, self };
  }
```

- As illustrated above, the `self` object must be made `Far`, since it will be subject to serialization.

## Persistent Weak Stores

The vat secondary storage system also includes a `makeWeakStore` function, which is identical in API to the `makeWeakStore` function provided by the `@agoric/store` package.  I.e., you call:

  `const ws = makeWeakStore();`

to obtain a new weak store instance, which you can then access using the `has`, `init`, `set`, `get`, and `delete` methods just as you would if you had imported `makeWeakStore` from `@agoric/store`.

However, the vat secondary storage system's `makeWeakStore` augments the one provided by the `@agoric/store` package in two important ways:

- Weak store operations may use virtual objects as keys, and if you do this the corresponding underlying virtual object instance identities will be used for indexing rather than the current in-memory object identities of the objects.

- The values set for weak store entries will be saved persistently to secondary storage.  This means that such weak stores can grow to be very large without impacting the vat's memory footprint.

Since weak store values are saved persistently, they must be serializable and will be hardened as soon as they are set.

An important caveat is that the latter entries are currently not actually weak, in the sense that if a virtual object becomes unreferenced, any corresponding weak store entries will not go away.  This is not semantically visible to vat code, but does impact the disk storage footprint of the vat.  Since the in-memory representations of virtual objects may come and go depending on the working state of the vat, there is no graceful way to garbage collect the underlying objects or corresponding weak store entries; a future system which can do robust distributed garbage collection should eventually rectify this, but for now you should not rely on any such garbage collection happening.
