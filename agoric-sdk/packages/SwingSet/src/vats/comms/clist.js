// add-*: the entry must not be present. add one.
// provide-*: return an entry, adding one if necessary

// we deal with three different kinds of slot namespace ("slotspace") here:
// 1: remote[NAME] : ro+NN/etc
// 2: local: o+NN/etc
// 3: kernel: same as local

// At each boundary, we translate all slot identifers (message targets,
// arguments, result promises, notification targets, resolution data) from
// one namespace to the other. This boundary is also where we manage
// promises: we keep track of who is the decider, and we prepare to notify
// the recipient of resolution. For promises that are already resolved, we
// queue up a resolution notification immediately, to be delivered after the
// message which contained that promise. For unresolved promises, we add the
// recipient to the subscriber list, so they'll be notified later.

// The translation process may add entries to the clist, or reference
// existing entries.

// For messages coming in from a remote machine, we start by translating
// those inbound messages from the remote's slotspace to our own (the comms
// vat). For messages coming from the kernel, we translate those outbound
// messages from the kernel slotspace to the local one.

// Then we figure out where the message is headed. Inbound messages are
// usually for a local vat, but they might be destined for a different remote
// (if we shared a third-party reference for the target), or maybe even the
// same remote who gave us the message (if the target is a promise that we
// resolved to them, but they haven't gotten the resolution message yet).
// Outbound messages (from the kernel) always start out headed to a remote
// system.

// Either kind of message might be directed at a promise that has been
// resolved to somthing undeliverable (data or rejection), in which case
// we'll reject any result promise, which will generate some number of
// notification messages (possibly headed somewhere else entirely).

// If the resulting message or notification is going to our kernel,translate
// the message from our local vat slotspace into the kernel slotspace (the
// namespaces are the same, but the act of "translation" is where we manage
// the Promises). If the message is headed to a remote machine, translate it
// into the destination remote's slotspace.
