/**
 * This module and its fraternal sibling legacyWeakMap exist only to
 * ease a transition to the modern `store` system, are deprecated,
 * and will eventually disappear. They are needed for now to support
 * some of the uses of the old behavior that are not compatible with
 * the new. The constraint imposed by the new is that only passables can
 * be used as values, and only keys (roughly, structures, aka comparables)
 * can be used as values.
 *
 * See https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/pull/3567
 * TODO Once that PR is merged, link to the documents rather than the PRs.
 *
 * Each of these non-conforming uses should be marked with a
 * ```js
 * // Legacy because...
 * ```
 * comment explaining the problem inhibiting conversion to the new
 * system. Some of these problems as if this writing:
 *    * A promiseKit used as a value, even though a promiseKit is not
 *      a passable. Solutions are to make it a passable, or to convert
 *      the container back to a conventional JavaScript Map.
 *    * A mutable array used as a value, that is subsequently mutated.
 *      Freezing the array wouldn't work of course because it would break
 *      the subsequent mutation. Using a far object wrapping an array would
 *      likely work fine.
 *
 * @deprecated switch to ScalarMap if possible, Map otherwise
 * @param {string} [keyName='key'] - the column name for the key
