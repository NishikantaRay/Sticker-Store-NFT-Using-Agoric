# ERTP - Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol

ERTP is Agoric's digital asset standard.

ERTP is a uniform way of transferring tokens and other digital
assets in JavaScript. All kinds of digital assets can be easily
created, but importantly, they can be transferred in exactly the same
ways, with exactly the same security properties.
