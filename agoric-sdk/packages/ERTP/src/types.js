/**
 * @typedef {Object} AmountMath
 * Logic for manipulating amounts.
 *
 * Amounts are the canonical description of tradable goods. They are manipulated

 * and

 * abstract right to participate in a particular exchange.

 * Please use the brand-first overload. The value-first overload
 * is deprecated and will go way.
 *
 * @property {AmountCoerce} coerce
 * Make sure this amount is valid enough, and return a corresponding
 * valid amount if so.
 * Please use the brand-first overload. The amount-first overload
 * is deprecated and will go way.
 *
 * @property {AmountGetValue} getValue
 * Extract and return the value.
 * Please use the brand-first overload. The amount-first overload
 * is deprecated and will go way.
 *
 * @property {MakeEmpty} makeEmpty
 * Return the amount representing an empty amount. This is the
 * identity element for MathHelpers.add and MatHelpers.subtract.
 *
 * @property {(amount: Amount) => Amount} makeEmptyFromAmount
 * Return the amount representing an empty amount, using another
 * amount as the template for the brand and assetKind.
 *
 * @property {(amount: Amount, brand?: Brand) => boolean} isEmpty
 * Return true if the Amount is empty. Otherwise false.
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount, brand?: Brand) => boolean} isGTE
 * Returns true if the leftAmount is greater than or equal to the
 * rightAmount. For non-scalars, "greater than or equal to" depends
 * on the kind of amount, as defined by the MathHelpers. For example,
 * whether rectangle A is greater than rectangle B depends on whether rectangle
 * A includes rectangle B as defined by the logic in MathHelpers.
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount, brand?: Brand) => boolean} isEqual
 * Returns true if the leftAmount equals the rightAmount. We assume
 * that if isGTE is true in both directions, isEqual is also true
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount, brand?: Brand) => Amount} add
 * Returns a new amount that is the union of both leftAmount and rightAmount.
 *
 * For fungible amount this means adding the values. For other kinds of
 * amount, it usually means including all of the elements from both
 * left and right.
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount, brand?: Brand) => Amount} subtract
 * Returns a new amount that is the leftAmount minus the rightAmount
 * (i.e. everything in the leftAmount that is not in the
 * rightAmount). If leftAmount doesn't include rightAmount
 * (subtraction results in a negative), throw  an error. Because the
 * left amount must include the right amount, this is NOT equivalent
 * to set subtraction.
