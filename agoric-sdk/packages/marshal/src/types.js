/**

 * PassStyle. A Passable must be hardened.
 *
 * A Passable has a pass-by-copy superstructure. This includes
 *    * the atomic pass-by-copy primitives ("undefined" | "null" |
 *      "boolean" | "number" | "bigint" | "string" | "symbol"),
 *    * the pass-by-copy containers ("copyArray" | "copyRecord") that
 *      contain other Passables,
 *    * and the special cases ("error" | "promise"), which
 *      also contain other Passables.
 *
 * A Passable's pass-by-copy superstructure ends in
 * PassableCap leafs ("remotable" | "promise"). Since a
 * Passable is hardened, its structure and classification is stable --- its
 * structure and classification cannot change even if some of the objects are
 * proxies.

/**
 * @typedef {Passable} Structure
 *
 * A Passable is a Structure when it contains only
 *    * pass-by-copy primitives,
 *    * pass-by-copy containers,
 *    * remotables.
 *
 * Two Structures may be compared by for equivalence according to
 * `sameStructure`, which is the strongest equivalence class supported by
 * marshal's distributed object semantics.
 *
 * Two Structures can also be compared for full ordering,
 *    * where their passStyles are ordered according to the
 *      PassStyle typedef above.
 *    * Two primitives of the same PassStyle are compared by the
 *      natural ordering of that primitive, with NaN greater than
 *      all other numbers and equivalent to itself.
 *    * All remotables are considered equivalent for purposes of
 *      ordering.
 *    * copyArrays are lexicographically ordered
 *    * copyRecords are lexicographically order according to the
 *      sorted order of their property names
 *    * copySets and copyMaps may have keys (such as remotables)
 *      which are equivalent for purposes of ordering. Thus, for
 *      purposes of ordering we consider them to be multisets (bags)
 *      and multimaps, so we recursively order according to the
 *      set of values associated with each equivalence class of keys.
