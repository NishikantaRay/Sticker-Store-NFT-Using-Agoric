User-visible changes in Cosmic SwingSet:

## Release 0.24.0 (2020-12-10)

* Upgrade to Cosmos SDK v0.40.0-rc4 (Stargate).

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The default block time (`commit_timeout`) has changed from `"2s"` back to
  `"5s"`, in the interest of ensuring globally-dispersed validators can
  participate without downtime.

## Release 0.21.2 (2020-10-11)

* Upgrade to Cosmos SDK v0.40.0 (Stargate) prerelease branch with local changes
  to temporarily disable "state-sync".

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The format of `$HOME/.ag-chain-cosmos/config/app.toml` has changed.  When you
  are going to reinitialize your validator, do the following to upgrade:
```sh
# Remove the old app.toml
rm ~/.ag-chain-cosmos/config/app.toml
# Initialize the new chain
ag-chain-cosmos init --overwrite <moniker>
```

* The `ag-cosmos-helper` default coin type is now `--coin-type=564`.  If you
  need to recover a key generated before this upgrade from its mnemonic, you
  will need: `ag-cosmos-helper keys add --coin-type=118 --recover <your-key-name>`.  If you
  generated the key after this point, you don't need to add a special option to
  recover it.
