	Connection is designed to be used in place of the "wifi" module in projects
	that need a continuously available connection to a Wi-Fi access point.

		- If no connection avaiable at start, retries until one is
		- Automatically attempts to reconnect when connection dropped
		- Disconnects when calling close
		- Supresses redundant WiFi.disconnect messages
		- Callback uses same message constants as "wifi"
		- Getter on "ready" is convenient way to check if Wi-Fi is connected
		- If connection attempt does not succeed with an IP address in 30 seconds, forces disconnect and retries
		- Wait 5 seconds after (unforced) disconnect to ensure clean reconnect
		- Try a list of access point in order using "getAP"
