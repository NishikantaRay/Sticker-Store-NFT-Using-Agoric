# Zoe

## What is Zoe?

Zoe is a framework for building smart contracts like auctions, swaps,
decentralized exchanges, and more. Zoe itself is a smart contract
written in JavaScript and running on the Agoric platform. 

_For users_: Zoe guarantees that as a user of a smart contract, you will
either get what you wanted or get a full refund, even if the smart
contract is buggy or malicious. (In fact, the smart contract never has
access to your digital assets.)

_For developers_: Zoe provides a safety net so you can focus on what
your smart contract does best, without worrying about your users
losing their assets due to a bug in the code that you wrote. Writing a
smart contract on Zoe is easy: all of the Zoe smart contracts are
written in the familiar language of JavaScript.
