/**
 * ** Create loan:
 *
 * requires an NFT attestation of brand BldAttLoc, and the amount of
 * RUN that can be loaned is about 10% of the value of BLD represented
 * in the attestation value: amount.value[0].value. (We should allow
 * for multiple elements in the value array, not just one, so we need
 * to iterate through amount.value)
 *
 * ** Add more collateral:
 *
 * Escrow more attestations of brand BldAttLoc. Contract must add the
 * internal BLD values (amount.value[0].value) together to get a total
 * sum of liened BLD.
 *
 * ** Withdraw more RUN:
 *
 * Only allowed if more collateral has been added (see above) or the
 * market value of the collateral has risen.
 *
 * ** Withdraw a partial amount of BLD attestation:
 *
 * Must have returned some RUN, or the market value of collateral has
 * risen, or the loan was overcollateralized to start. Contract calls
 * a publicFacet method in the attestation contract that allows it to
 * split an attestation into multiple versions? Would require no offer
 * safety for the collateral, but that would be true already
 *
 * ** Withdraw all BLD attestation:
 *
 * Must pay back the loan. User gets the bld attestation back, needs
 * to make an offer to the attestation contract to turn it back in.
 *
 *
 * ------
 * A fungible BLD attestation would be better suited to the RUN LoC as
 * we could just reuse vault code (after removing without
 * liquidation). But that would require being incredibly careful to
 * only allow redemptions of attestations to unlien tokens
 * appropriately. In other words, we have to ensure total conservation
 * of funds on the cosmos side (unliening can't create tokens), and we
 * have to ensure at the very least, that if a fungible NFT
 * attestation is transferred and another person returns it, they
 * cannot unlien more than they liened, and the system should not
 * error if that's the case, just disallow it.
 *
 * michaelfig identified an additional problem with fungible
 * attestation tokens in which redeeming someone else's fungible
 * tokens can make a user's own fungible attestations tokens
 * unredeemable, but with no external indications of this new change
 * in their functionality.
