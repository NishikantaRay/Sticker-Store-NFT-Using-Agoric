   * If we already know the entire issuer record, such as for a

   * store the issuerRecord directly.
   *
   * A note on checking that the issuer and brand match: Because of
   * how we use `storeIssuerRecord`, the issuer and brand in the
   * `issuerRecord` parameter are guaranteed to match, and we do not
   * need to do another asynchronous call.
   *
   * We use `storeIssuerRecord` in 4 cases: 1) ZoeMint records, 2)
   * ZCFMint records, 3) within `storeIssuer`, and 4) storing an
   * issuer record in ZCF that we obtained from Zoe that originally
   * went through `storeIssuer`. In ZoeMints (repackaged as ZCFMints),
   * we create the issuers and brands ourselves using ERTP directly,
   * so we know they are not malicious and that the issuers and brands
   * match. In the last two cases, we go through the
   * brand-issuer-match check in `storeIssuer`.
   *
   * The reason why we need the `has` check below is for the 4th case
   * above, in which we store an issuer record in ZCF that we obtained
   * from Zoe. `WeakStore.init` errors if the key is already present,
   * and because an issuer can be used more than once in the same
   * contract, we need to make sure we aren't trying to `init` twice.
   * If the issuer and its record are already present, we do not need
   * to add the issuer again in ZCF.
