/**
 * By analogy with how `Array.prototype.map` will map the elements of
 * an array to transformed elements of an array of the same shape,
 * `objectMap` will do likewise for the string-named own enumerable
 * properties of an object.
 *
 * `objectMap` is a convenience over
 *    * using `Object.entries` to convert these property values into an array
 *      of `[key, value]` pairs,
 *    * a normal array map with this list and the provided callback, hopefully
 *      producing a similar array of `[key, mappedValue]` pairs,
 *    * using `Object.fromEntries` to put it all back together in a new
 *      object whose own properties are according to that list of
 *      mapped pairs.
 *
 * Some edge cases to be aware of
 *    * If any of the original properties were accessors, `Object.entries`
 *      will cause its `getter` to be called and will use the resulting
 *      value.
 *    * No matter whether the original property was an accessor, writable,
 *      or configurable, all the properties of the returned object will be
 *      writable, configurable, data properties.
 *    * No matter what the original object may have inherited from, and
 *      no matter whether it was a special kind of object such as an array,
 *      the returned object will always be a plain object inheriting directly
 *      from `Object.prototype` and whose state is only these new mapped
 *      own properties.
 *    * The caller-provided mapping function can map the entry to a new entry
 *      with a different key, in which case the new object will have those
 *      keys as its property names rather than the original's.
 *
 * Typical usage will be to apply `objectMap` to a pass-by-copy record, i.e.,
 * and object for which `passStyleOf(original) === 'copyRecord'`. For these,
 * none of these edge cases arise. If the mapping does not introduce
 * symbol-named properties, then the result, once hardened, will also be a
 * pass-by-copy record.
 *

 * @template {keyof T} K
