 * noTransaction, indicating that no trade should take place. This can be due to
 * a request for more assets than the pool holds, a specified price the current
 * assets won't support, or the trade would requre more than the trader allowed,
 * or provide less, or fees would eat up all the trader's proceeds.
 *
 * We start by calculating the amounts that would be traded if no fees were
 * charged. The actual fees are based on these amounts. Once we know the actual
 * fees, we calculate the deltaX and deltaY that will best maintain the
 * constant product invariant.
 *
 * The amounts by which the pool will be adjusted, that the trader will pay and
 * receive, and the fees are then computed based on deltaX and deltaY.
