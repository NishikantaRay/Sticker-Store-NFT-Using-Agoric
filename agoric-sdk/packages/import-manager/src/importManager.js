/**
 * ImportManager allows a package to make some code available that can be run
 * locally by a calling vat without requiring a remote round trip to the hosting
 * vat. Remote code can indicate what function to run using a key.
 *
 * Long term, we may want to import from a well-known repository, and manage
 * version upgrades, but for now, we just import the code from the file system.
 *
 * A package that wanted to export some code for clients to run in their own vat
 * would import or define some functions, then call
 *
 *   const mgr = importManager();
 *   return mgr.addExports(
 *     {
 *        'usefulFn', export1,
 *        'helpfulFn', export2,
 *      });
 *
 * then it could pass strings like 'usefulFn' to clients, who could import the
 * manager above, then call
 *
 * const genericFn = importer.lookupImport(name);
