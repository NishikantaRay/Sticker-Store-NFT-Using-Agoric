## Inspiration
Whatsapp Stickers have become the most used asset. These have truly changed the style of communication with people. They have made Conversations more easier and engaging. To give a push to the sticker creators. As they are only getting credits but no money by making stickers. With this nft system, they can make some amount of money.
## What it does
Creators can list their stickers on this web application and the customers can buy the sticker as per their choice. Agoric will help in giving a safe, reusable library of DeFi components to rapidly build and deploy on-chain. All the transactions are safe and assured.
## How we built it
We built it using agoric and react
## Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges while running the project as it was a very heavy file. And we made it in a very less amount of time.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully deployed our idea to the web application we made in very little time.
## What we learned
We learnt about NFTs and agoric
## What's next for Sticker Store
We will try to make it more user friendly, add various types of stickers, and give more opportunities to the Sticker Creators
